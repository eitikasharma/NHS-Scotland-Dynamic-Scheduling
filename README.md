# NHS-Scotland-Dynamic-Scheduling
This project develops a learning-based dynamic scheduling system to optimize NHS Scotland's workforce, reducing patient waiting times. It involves data collection, EDA, ARIMA demand forecasting, and workforce optimization, enhancing healthcare delivery efficiency.

# Learning-Based Dynamic Scheduling Workforce System for NHS Scotland

# Problem Statement
NHS Scotland is facing a sustainability crisis due to an imbalance between capacity and demand, which is exacerbated by workforce shortages, system inefficiencies, low government investment, and inadequate infrastructure. One of the critical issues is the prolonged waiting times for patients, with 90% of patients receiving therapy referrals only after 18 weeks.

# Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to develop a learning-based dynamic scheduling workforce system to optimize the workforce across NHS Scotland. 
This system aims to:
1. Reduce patient waiting times.
2. Efficiently redistribute the available workforce to meet demand.
3. Predict future patient demand and workforce availability using time series forecasting techniques.

# Methodology

1. Data Collection and Processing:
-Gathered historical data on patient numbers, doctor availability, and other relevant metrics.
-Processed and cleaned the data for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
-Conducted EDA to understand the trends and patterns in the data.
-Visualized the number of patients and doctors over time to identify key insights.

3. Demand and Supply Prediction:
-Used the ARIMA model to forecast future patient demand.
-Predicted GP availability and identified areas with workforce shortages.

4. Optimization and Implementation:
-Developed a dynamic scheduling system to optimize workforce distribution.
-Integrated the scheduling system with existing NHS infrastructure for continuous improvement.

# Findings
-A significant increase in patient numbers was observed, particularly in Glasgow.
-A declining trend in the number of doctors was noted, highlighting the need for better workforce management.
-The ARIMA model effectively predicted future patient demand, enabling proactive workforce planning.

# Conclusion
This project presents a robust solution to manage the workforce more effectively within NHS Scotland. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, the dynamic scheduling system can help reduce waiting times and improve the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery.
